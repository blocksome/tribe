# tribe


tribe, the premier infant/toddler care app. tribe manages your tasks and tracks your child's growth with an easy-to-use user interface, making it a leader in the childcare industry. With over 4 great features and more to come, tribe is the equivalent of having more guardians for your child. After all, it takes a village to raise one.
 
## Design Process
 
tribe was built with its creator's, Joses', niece in mind. Joses' niece was a young child growing up in a modern world where technology was advanced enough to keep track of her activities on social media. However, one thing was missing.

There was no app on the market that really catered to digitally scrapbooking young children's memories. So Joses made one. Taking from his experiences of being a potential user and surveying his relatives who had kids, he came to understand what kind of accessibility he would need for the app.

## Features
 
### Existing Features
- Account System - tribe has a user account database system that allows for your data to be carried through the cloud, so you can access your memories on any smart device that carries tribe.

- Digital Scrapbook - tribe's main pride and joy. The Digital Scrapbook allows users to record memories of their precious one for safekeeping. An ageless piece of time, kept forever in your account. 

You can edit Scrapbook Entries and delete individual ones. With this level of control, it'll really feel like a real scrapbook.

### Future Features
- Images for Digital Scrapbook - We want to take your keepsakes a step further. By introducing image sharing for Scrapbook Entries, you'll be able to not only read out when happened that day, but see, too! 

The image button for scrapbook is not working at the moment. DO NOT CREATE ENTRIES WITH IMAGES.

- Health Tracker - As much as we want to watch our kids grow, we want to watch them do so healthily. This health tracker will track users' children's weight, height and food intake.
